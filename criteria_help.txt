Computes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz's Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), the Hannan-Quinn criterion (HQC) and the corrected AIC (AICc), given ess (error sum of squares), the number of observations (n), 
and the number of coefficients (k).

The AIC is computed as in Akaike's original (1974) formulation, 
namely AIC = -2L + 2k, where L denotes the maximized log-likelihood. 

The BIC is computed as BIC = -2L + k log n.

The HQC is computed as HQC = -2L + 2k log log n.

The AICc is computed as AICc = AIC + (2*k(k+1)) / (n-k-1).

A row vector containing the four criteria is available for
assignment on return.
